          When it comes to chili, seasoning your meat is key to building a rich and flavorful base for the dish. 
          For this recipe, we’re working with two pounds of ground beef, and the seasoning starts before the meat even hits the crockpot. 
          A blend of Chipotle garlic barbecue seasoning, garlic powder, steak seasoning, salt, and pepper creates a robust and smoky flavor. 
          The Chipotle brings a subtle heat, while the garlic powder and steak seasoning add depth. 
          This combination perfectly prepares the beef to soak up all the other flavors as it slow-cooks in the crockpot.

          One of the most exciting ingredients in this chili is the stout beer. 
          It might seem surprising, but stout beer adds an incredible layer of flavor. 
          The dark, malty richness of the stout enhances the chili’s depth, giving it a slight bitterness that balances the sweetness from the onions and tomato puree.
           It also pairs well with the smoky spices, creating a complex flavor profile that makes every bite interesting.

          stout gives the chili a meaty backbone that brings everything together.

          The best part about this chili is that it simmers low and slow in a crockpot, allowing the ingredients to meld together and develop deep, bold flavors. 
          After a few hours of cooking, the beef becomes tender, and the beans soak up the delicious broth. 
          By the time it’s ready to eat, the aroma of smoky spices, beef, and stout fills the kitchen, making the anticipation almost unbearable. 
          The flavors marry together so well that every spoonful brings

          Of course, no bowl of chili is complete without sourdough bread, cheese, and cilantro. 
          The tang of the sourdough cuts through the richness of the chili, providing the perfect vessel to scoop up each bite. 
          A generous sprinkling of cheese melts into the chili, adding a creamy, indulgent layer that balances the spice. 
          Finally, the cilantro—if you’re one of the lucky ones who love it—adds a fresh, herby brightness that lifts the entire dish. 
          These finishing touches aren’t just optional; they’re essential to truly enjoying the full experience of this chili. 
          Important to note, the leftover chili is always better than same day chili

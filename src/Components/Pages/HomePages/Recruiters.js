    "During my time as an Audio Visual Engineer, I have racked up over three years of experience doing a multitude of tasks and working with a diverse range of individuals. From college age peers to senior executives at the largest law firm in the world, I have serviced them all to give the best experience possible. While at Loyola Chicago, I worked through many different scenarios and events that gave me the foundation through fire that allows me to succeed and thrive in the Audio-Visual environment. Loyola was a combination of tech stuck in time and conference rooms that were updated while I was there. This range allowed me to be successful in my next position at Kirkland and Ellis. Kirkland and Ellis was undergoing a move while I was hired on, which gave me excellent opportunities to install and service all of the newest AV equipment money could buy. Following the installation and troubleshooting process, I was given the esteemed opportunity to offer white glove service to many notable professionals such as Jon Ballis and Chiara Wrocinski. This extensive experience has equipped me with the technical expertise and customer service skills necessary to succeed as an Audio-Visual Engineer in any demanding environment.",
    "While I have a year plus in experience at data analytics from my internships, I was incredibly passionate about it during my time at university and have tried to incorporate it in every part of my career and personal life. During my time at TLC wafer technology, I was first taught SQL and was given the time to dip my feet into python statistical programming.  Following that time, I was given the ability to query and work on large data modules at my time at the Brag House. This was a foundational time not only for SQL but also for Excel. Using the combination of these experiences, I was well prepared when I was designing my Practicum for Loyola Chicago. Rambler Registrar was a new and updated app that was an attempt at revolutionizing the class scheduling for Loyola students. This required me to make an app that used complex algorithms to sort all of the classes students had to take, but also sorted and curtailed classes students needed to take for their future goals as well. Based on my experience in SQL, Python, and data management, as well as my passion for data analytics, I am confident that I would excel as a data analyst at your company.",
    "I have three plus years of experience working in the IT field, supporting the IT department in various capacities. While there are many things that go into making a good IT specialist, I believe technical expertise, adaptability, and communication are key. At Loyola Chicago, I worked closely with the IT department to troubleshoot and resolve issues with AV systems and other technology across campus, which honed my problem-solving skills. My adaptability was put to the test at Kirkland and Ellis, where I supported the IT team during a major office relocation, helping to install and configure the latest AV and IT equipment. Throughout these roles, effective communication was critical, as I often needed to explain technical issues to non-technical users and collaborate with the IT department to ensure seamless service delivery. These experiences have given me a strong foundation to thrive in IT environments.",
